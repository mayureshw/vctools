Virtual Circuit simulator and some other tools for the AHIR framework

As the documentation grew in size and required more powerful formating, we have moved it to docs/manual.tex. You may compile it into a pdf by simply running command 'pdflatex manual.tex', assuming you have Latex installed.

For quick access a pre-compiled copy of the manual is kept at this location: [AHIR Virtual Circuit Simulator User Manual](http://mayuresh.warunjikar.in/vctools/manual.pdf)
